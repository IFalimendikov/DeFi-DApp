**DeFi DApp Architecture**
<br />

DApp schema above is a (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to simplify and optimize yield farming (earning interest or rewards) by automatically allocating users' funds to the highest-yielding protocols in the DeFi ecosystem. DApp works through a combination of smart contracts, governance tokens, and a community-driven development model. This DApp should have a list of below listed functionalities:

1) Depositing funds: Users deposit their cryptocurrency assets, such as DAI, USDC, or ETH, into DApp's smart contracts called "vaults." These vaults are essentially pools of funds that the DApp manages.

2) Yield farming strategies: DApp should employs a variety of strategies to maximize returns for users. These strategies involve lending, staking, or providing liquidity to various DeFi platforms such as Compound, Aave, or Curve etc. The DApp should continuously scan the DeFi market for the best opportunities and reallocates users' funds accordingly.

3) Earning interest and rewards: As a result of the smart allocation of funds, users earn interest and rewards in the form of tokens. These rewards are automatically reinvested to compound the returns.

4) Withdrawing funds: Users can withdraw their funds, along with any accrued interest, at any time by interacting with the vault smart contracts. Withdrawals are subject to fees and, in some cases, lockup periods.

5) Governance: DApp should be governed by its native token. Token holders can participate in the platform's governance by voting on proposals, which can include changes to the protocols or strategies.


In summary, above mentioned DApp works by pooling users' funds, automatically allocating them to the highest-yielding DeFi protocols, and distributing the earned interest and rewards back to users. The platform should be governed by its native token, which allows token holders to participate in the decision-making process.

**Example from a schema**
<br />

On a schema there's an example of a DApp functionality with ETH and DAI pools yield farming. 

In the current strategy after a user deposits ETH into the Vault, the ETH is put into a MakerDAO lending platform as collateral. By supplying ETH collateral to MakerDAO the ETH strategy can borrow DAI at 200% collateralization ratio.

Borrowed DAI is then put into the DApp Treasury Vault that uses a yield maximizing strategy that deposits DAI to a pool  with stable coins consisting of DAI, USDC, USDT and TUSD, as a result in getting rewarded with extra CRV tokens, on top of standard trading fees generated by just supplying liquidity to a pool. 

The ETH strategy then periodically sells LP tokens for ETH and uses the accrued trading fees from the liquidity pool to accrue even more interest. These steps all put together can, result in high returns on ETH deposited to the ETH Treasury Vaul, although risk optimization should still be a priority.
